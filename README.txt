This is the application I have created to help facilitate the efficient use of AFEES services on CATC Camp Fuji when the base is packed with 
training units. Using this application, personnel don't have to wait in line for the barber for hours at a time, and can go to the gym or
do their laundry without worrying about missing their place.
